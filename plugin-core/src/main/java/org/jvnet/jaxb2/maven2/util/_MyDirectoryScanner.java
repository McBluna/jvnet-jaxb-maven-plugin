/**
 * Class for scanning a directory for files/directories which match certain
 * criteria.
 * <p>
 * These criteria consist of selectors and patterns which have been specified.
 * With the selectors you can select which files you want to have included.
 * Files which are not selected are excluded. With patterns you can include or
 * exclude files based on their filename.
 * <p>
 * The idea is simple. A given directory is recursively scanned for all files
 * and directories. Each file/directory is matched against a set of selectors,
 * including special support for matching against filenames with include and and
 * exclude patterns. Only files/directories which match at least one pattern of
 * the include pattern list or other file selector, and don't match any pattern
 * of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required selector will
 * be placed in the list of files/directories found.
 * <p>
 * When no list of include patterns is supplied, "**" will be used, which means
 * that everything will be matched. When no list of exclude patterns is
 * supplied, an empty list is used, such that nothing will be excluded. When no
 * selectors are supplied, none are applied.
 * <p>
 * The filename pattern matching is done as follows: The name to be matched is
 * split up in path segments. A path segment is the name of a directory or file,
 * which is bounded by <code>File.separator</code> ('/' under UNIX, '\' under
 * Windows). For example, "abc/def/ghi/xyz.java" is split up in the segments
 * "abc", "def","ghi" and "xyz.java". The same is done for the pattern against
 * which should be matched.
 * <p>
 * The segments of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other.
 * When '**' is used for a path segment in the pattern, it matches zero or more
 * path segments of the name.
 * <p>
 * There is a special case regarding the use of <code>File.separator</code>s at
 * the beginning of the pattern and the string to match:<br>
 * When a pattern starts with a <code>File.separator</code>, the string to match
 * must also start with a <code>File.separator</code>. When a pattern does not
 * start with a <code>File.separator</code>, the string to match may not start
 * with a <code>File.separator</code>. When one of these rules is not obeyed,
 * the string will not match.
 * <p>
 * When a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment, the
 * following special characters can be used:<br>
 * '*' matches zero or more characters<br>
 * '?' matches one character.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * "**\*.class" matches all .class files/dirs in a directory tree.
 * <p>
 * "test\a??.java" matches all files/dirs which start with an 'a', then two more
 * characters and then ".java", in a directory called test.
 * <p>
 * "**" matches everything in a directory tree.
 * <p>
 * "**\test\**\XYZ*" matches all files/dirs which start with "XYZ" and where
 * there is a parent directory called test (e.g. "abc\test\def\ghi\XYZ123").
 * <p>
 * Case sensitivity may be turned off if necessary. By default, it is turned on.
 * <p>
 * Example of usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * String [] includes = { "**\\*.class" };
 * String [] excludes = { "modules\\*\\**" };
 * ds.setIncludes (includes);
 * ds.setExcludes (excludes);
 * ds.setBasedir (new File ("test"));
 * ds.setCaseSensitive (true);
 * ds.scan ();
 *
 * System.out.println ("FILES:");
 * String [] files = ds.getIncludedFiles ();
 * for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++)
 * {
 *   System.out.println (files[i]);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This will scan a directory called test for .class files, but excludes all
 * files in all proper subdirectories of a directory called "modules"
